# Fun Recall
## Overview
This mod grants players the ability to warp back to their spawn point using a special keybind ("B" by default).

When recalling, players have to stand still for 5 seconds in order to warp back and any movement or damage taken will interrupt the process, afflicting the player with Recall Exhaustion - an effect that renders one unable to recall and their movements slower.
